# final_project

to do: 
    Create: 
        user buys tickets
        change the action when 'purchase' is clicked (routing)
        when 'book flight' is clicked, somehow push that data either to my database or to Auth0's database 
    Read: 
        update the 'book a flight' page to pull available ticket information from database
    Update: 
        users need to be able to edit their ticket information, date or location or something 
    Delete: 
        users would cancel or refund a flight 

ideas: 
    do the same thing as before to get tokens, but rename the functions so they begin with capital letters
